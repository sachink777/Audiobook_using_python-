# Audiobook_using_python-

Reading is something that we human should do everyday to improve knowledge. However, due to busy schedule sometimes many peaple do not get time
to read. Here i have built basic book reader fucntion using pyhton programming language. To create this project i have used two libraries Pypdf2
to read the pdf file and second one is Pyttsx3. Pyttsx3 basically convert text into speech.
